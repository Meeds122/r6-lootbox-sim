This is a project to simulate the loot box drop system of rainbow 6 siege. The constants are currently set for a 50% win rate and the lootbox drop rates of the casual mode.

The results show that a player with a 1:1 win:loss ratio playing in the casual gamemode should recieve about 7.7 loot box drops per 100 games.
